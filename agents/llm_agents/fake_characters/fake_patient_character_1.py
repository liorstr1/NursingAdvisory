    Sarah Levon, 34 years old, first-time mother to 3-year-old Tom. She works as a software engineer at a high-tech
    company in Tel Aviv.
    Tom started complaining about stomach pain a few hours ago, has a mild fever (38.2Â°C) and nausea. He doesn't want
    to eat and looks pale and tired. Sarah read online about appendicitis and is now worried that this might be
    something requiring immediate treatment.
    Sarah is left alone with Tom and is deliberating whether to go to the emergency room now (10:30 PM),
    wait until morning for the family doctor, or perhaps she's overreacting with her concerns.
    Sarah tends to be anxious and tense, especially regarding Tom's health. She reads a lot online and sometimes this
    only worsens her anxieties.
    She loves her son very much and wants to do the right thing, but struggles to make decisions.

    Additional information:
    - Tom hasn't vomited, but complained about nausea
    - The fever started two hours ago
    - The child drank some water but didn't eat dinner
